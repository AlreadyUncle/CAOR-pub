In this repository, 
- I set up different simulation environments in ROS Gazebo (see "simulation worlds") to test a real-time odometry estimation based on LSTM and RNN methods. The odometry method itself is not included.
- I processed IMU data and 3D LIDAR point cloud from KITTI dataset in python and applied Hector SLAM. You can see the error analysis in "hector slam results".
